I wanted to open my rollershutters when sun is rising. A very simple task I thought. I all need was an **openHAB2** installation, at least one configured **rollershutter** and the **astro binding**.  

A rule to open a shutter on sunrise event could be

~~~ ruby
rule "Rollershutter up on sunrise"
when 
	Item Sunrise_Event changes from 0 to 1
then
	shutter.sendCommand(UP)
end
~~~

But...

... in summer the sun rises very early in the morning and opening the rollershutter would wake me up long before I have to stand up. On the other side in winter the day starts very late. The solution should be a time slot: I want the rollershutter to get open at sunrise, but not before 7 o'clock and not later than half past 8.

Therefor I create a special astro-thing...

~~~ ruby
astro:sun:shutter  [ geolocation="52.520824,13.409414", interval=300] {
    Channels:
        Type start : rise#start [
            earliest="07:00",
            latest="08:30"
        ]
}
~~~

... that I can trigger in a rule ...

~~~ ruby
rule "Rollershutter up on sunrise"
when
	Channel 'astro:sun:shutter:rise#event' triggered START
then
	shutter.sendCommand(UP)
end
~~~

Closing the rollershutter on sunset works similar of course.

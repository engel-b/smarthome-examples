I wanted to open my rollershutters when sun is rising. A very simple task I thought. I all need was an **openHAB2** installation at least one configured **rollershutter** and the **astro binding**.  

To open on sunrise event 
{% highlight ruby %}
rule "Rollershutter up on sunrise"
when 
	Item Sunrise_Event changes from 0 to 1
then
	shutter.sendCommand(UP)
end
{% endhighlight %}

But...

... in summer the sun rises very early in the morning and opening the rollershutter would wake me up long before I have to stand up. On the other side in winter the day starts very late. The solution should be a time slot: I want the rollershutter to get open at sunrise, but not before 6 o'clock and not later than 9 o'clock. That's it.
  
{% highlight ruby %}
rule "Grouping shutters"
when 
	Item AllShutters received command
then
	ShuttersGroup.members.forEach[shutter|
			shutter.sendCommand(receivedCommand)
		]
end
{% endhighlight %}

Closing the rollershutter on sunset works similar of course.

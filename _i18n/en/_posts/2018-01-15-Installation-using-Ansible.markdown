When I first setup my homeautomation server, I documented nothing.

Next I wrote in a textfile a step-by-step-guide where I listed each command I entered.

In a project at work I learned to love the tool ansible. I had to setup a hole stage with several machines with different jobs. Ansible runs the in xml written installation to one or more machines. Different to puppet or chef it does not need a configuration server.
